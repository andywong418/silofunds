      p#giveMeAMargin By donating to a student who has affiliated with his/her target institution, your donations will go straight to the associated college, faculty or university.  This will bring about a number of benefits:
      ul
        li You can claim tax back on your donations via gift aid.
        li Your donations can increase the effectiveness of scholarships offered by your associated college or faculty.
        li The funds can be distributed to the student in installments - ensuring student motivation of working to maintain the flow of funding.
      p In the event that the student withdraws or receives incomplete funding, the donations made to the associated college or faculty will be used to part fund other similar students.
      p If you have any further queries, please email
