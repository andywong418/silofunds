      p#giveMeAMargin By agreeing to affiliate with a college, your donations will go directly into your target university/college account. This will bring about a number of benefits:
      ul
        li Your donors can claim tax back on their donations via gift aid - increasing the probability of giving.
        li You will appear on a specific Silo page that colleges will advertise to their alumni and other potential donors - connecting you with individuals who are interested in your research and your cause.
        li Donors can be assured that the your profile is approved of and that the college/university can pay you back given you do not reach your goal.
        li The increased engagement with your college/university can bring about benefits for you - such as more scholarships and bursaries.
      p Once you show that you can take up your place - the college can transfer the funding allocated back to you, either all in one go or via installments.
      p If you have any further queries, please email  
        a(href='mailto:support@silofunds.com') our support team.
